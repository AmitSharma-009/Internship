### Assessment of data quality and completeness in preparation for analysis
Sprocket Central Pty Ltd, a mid-sized bike and accessories company, needs assistance analyzing its customer and transaction data to optimize its marketing strategy. Although the company holds extensive data, the team is uncertain about how to extract actionable insights.

The Associate Director stressed the importance of data quality in driving business growth:
“The better the dataset’s quality, the higher the chances of success.”

Transactions (Last 3 Months)

Conduct a data quality assessment, identify key issues, and suggest strategies for improvement. Draft an email to the client summarizing your findings and recommendations.

# Task 2
