## Task - 1
### Project Understanding:
**A data analyst sits between the business and the data.**

 - One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
 - She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
 - Mae has scheduled a project kick-off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.
 - About Client : [Social Buzz](https://github.com/minhaj-313/-Accenture-Data-Analytics-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Data_Analytics%20Client%20Brief.pdf)

#### Task for Accenture : 

 >- Client's Problem that Accenture is tasked to address: The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.
 >- Three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill: Audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, analysis of popular content
 
 #### Task for Data Analyst :
Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

In short, the client wanted to see **“An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.** 

## Task - 2
 - Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
 - So, the first step is to use this [data model](#) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
 >- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
 >- Content ID
 >- Reaction Types
 >- Content type
 >- Category
 
### Data Cleaning:
#### Clean the data by:
 - removing rows that have values that are missing,
 - changing the data type of some values within a column, and
 - removing columns that are not relevant to this task.
 - - Think about how each column might be relevant to the business question you’re investigating. If you can’t think of why a column may be useful, it may not be worth including it.

**End result will be a cleaned data set:**

### Data Modelling:

**Create a final data set by merging 3 tables**
**End result will be one spreadsheet**
 - A cleaned dataset
 - Top 5 categories
 
 ### Cleaned Data set:
 So, the cleaned data set after data modelling & data cleaning : [Cleaned Dataset](https://github.com/minhaj-313/-Accenture-Data-Analytics-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Content%20-%20Reaction%20Type%20-%20Reaction.csv)
 
 ## Task - 3
 ### Data Visualization and Storytelling:
 **Make the PowerPoint presentation as per the given template**
 
 - Powerpoint Presentation : [PPT](https://github.com/minhaj-313/-Accenture-Data-Analytics-Visualization-Virtual-Internship/blob/main/Accenture%20Internship%20PowerPoint%20presentation%20-%20Task%203%20By%20Minhaj.pptx)
 
 ## Task - 4
 ### Present to the Client:
 **Present your PowerPoint presentation to the client and deliver the insights of your analysis**
