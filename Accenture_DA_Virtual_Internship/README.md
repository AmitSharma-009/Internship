# Accenture North America - Data Analytics and Visualization

## Project Overview:
Welcome to my repository for the Accenture Data Analytics and Visualization Virtual Internship. This immersive program, offered through Forage, provided a unique opportunity to tackle real-world data challenges, enhancing my analytical and visualization skills in a business context.

## Project Objective
The primary goal was to assist a fictional client, Social Buzz, in leveraging their extensive data to gain actionable insights. The project encompassed:

- **Data Cleaning and Preparation:** Ensuring data integrity and readiness for analysis.
- **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA):** Uncovering patterns and trends within the data.
- **Data Visualization:** Crafting compelling visual narratives to communicate findings.
- **Business Recommendations:** Providing strategic advice based on data-driven insights.

## Key Deliverables
1. **Data Cleaning and Modeling:**
- Processed datasets to remove inconsistencies and irrelevant information.
- Integrated multiple data sources to create a cohesive dataset for analysis.
2. **Exploratory Data Analysis:**
- Conducted thorough analyses to identify key trends and insights.
- Focused on metrics such as content popularity across various categories and user engagement patterns.
3. **Data Visualization and Storytelling:**
- Developed interactive dashboards using Excel to present findings.
- Created a comprehensive presentation to convey insights and recommendations effectively.

## Learning Outcomes
Participating in this virtual internship enabled me to:

- Enhance my proficiency in data cleaning and preprocessing techniques.
- Develop a deeper understanding of exploratory data analysis methodologies.
- Strengthen my ability to create insightful data visualizations that inform business decisions.
- Gain experience in formulating strategic recommendations based on data insights.

## Client Overview:
- **Client Name:** Social Buzz
- **Industry:** Social media & content creation
- **Established:** 2010
- **HQ Location:** San Francisco
- **Number of Employees:** 250

## Project Details:
- Conducted a thorough audit, identifying key areas for enhancement to optimize data management and analytics.
- Provided strategic recommendations to ensure a successful Initial Public Offering (IPO), focusing on data-driven decision-making and operational efficiency.
- Analyzed content categories, highlighting the top five with the highest aggregate popularity, thereby offering insights to boost user engagement and platform growth.

## Task - 1
### Project Understanding:
**A data analyst sits between the business and the data.**

 - One of Accenture’s Managing Directors, Mae Mulligan, is the client lead for Social Buzz.
 - She has reviewed the brief provided by Social Buzz and has assembled a diverse team of Accenture experts to deliver the project.
 - Mae has scheduled a project kick-off call with the internal Accenture project team for tomorrow morning.

#### Task for Accenture : 

 >- Client's Problem that Accenture is tasked to address: The client has reached a massive scale within recent years and does not have the resources internally to handle it.
 >- Three requirements that Accenture is tasked to fulfill: Audit of big data practice, recommendations for IPO, analysis of popular content
 
 #### Task for Data Analyst :
Analysis of sample data sets with visualizations to understand the popularity of different content categories.

In short, the client wanted to see **“An analysis of their content categories showing the top 5 categories with the largest popularity”.** 

## Task - 2
 - Often you won’t need all these datasets to find what you’re looking for.
 - So, the first step is to use this [data model](#) to identify which datasets will be required to answer your business question - which is to figure out the top 5 categories with the largest popularity.
 - After Analysis we got data sets needed to complete analysis:
 >- Reaction Score(score is used to quantified the popularity)
 >- Content ID
 >- Reaction Types
 >- Content type
 >- Category
 
 ## Task - 3
 ### Data Visualization and Storytelling:
 **Make the PowerPoint presentation as per the given template**
 
 ## Task - 4
 ### Present to the Client:
 **Present your PowerPoint presentation to the client and deliver the insights of your analysis** 

## Acknowledgments
I extend my gratitude to Accenture and Forage for offering this valuable virtual internship experience. The project simulated real-world scenarios that enhanced my data analytics and visualization skills, preparing me for future professional challenges.
